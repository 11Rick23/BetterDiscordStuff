# BetterDiscordStuff
my BD plugins & themes, focused on enhancing user experience

plugins:

  **Force-Close**
  
    Actually closes discord when clicking the close button.

  **Clear-Input-on-Escape**
  
    Clears the chat input when you hit escape inside it.

themes:

  **Drag-Fix**
  
    Makes it way easier to move the window.

  **No-Pulsing-User-List**
  
    Removes the pulsing animation from the user list which normally is shown while the list is loading. Sometimes (in my case always on BD server) the list never loads.

  **Show-URLs**
  
    Shows a link's URL in bottom left corner much like a browser does.
