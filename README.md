# BetterDiscordStuff
my BD plugins & themes, focused on enhancing user experience

plugins:

  **[Restart-No-More](plugins/restartNoMore.plugin.js)** _alpha version_
  
    Abandons the need for restarting/reloading discord to get your new plugins and themes.
	Especially useful for development.

  **[Force-Close](plugins/forceClose.plugin.js)**
  
    Actually closes discord when clicking the close button.

  **[Clear-Input-on-Escape](plugins/clearInputOnEsc.plugin.js)**
  
    Clears the chat input when you hit escape inside it.

  **[Link-Profile-Picture](plugins/linkProfilePicture.plugin.js)**
  
    Lets you click users' avatars on their profile page to view a bigger version in your browser.

themes:

  **[Drag-Fix](themes/dragfix.theme.css)**
  
    Makes it way easier to move the window.

  **[No-Pulsing-User-List](themes/noPulsingUserList.theme.css)**
  
    Removes the pulsing animation from the user list which normally is shown while the list is loading.
	Sometimes (in my case on BD server when it's overloaded) the list never finishes loading.

  **[Show-URLs](/themes/showURLs.theme.css)**
  
    Shows a link's URL in bottom left corner much like a browser does.
